Randy Chen's report on testing Ashton Shears's Week 10 Project.

1) Pass!
2) Failed.
3) Failed.
4) Failed.
5) Failed.
6) Failed.
7) Failed.
8) Failed.
9) Failed.
10) Failed.

I kept getting an internal server error whenever I tried to log in. Looks
an sql query in app.py was causing issues. Unfortunately, I am unable to test 
anything else. I hope this is fixed before the final submission!
